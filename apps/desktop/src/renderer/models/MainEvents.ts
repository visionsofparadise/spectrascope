/**
 * Wraps the IPC event bridge in a normal Node EventEmitter so renderer code
 * can subscribe and unsubscribe by function identity. The IPC bridge is
 * subscribed to once per event name at construction; consumers register
 * against this emitter only. Without this layer, every React effect that
 * subscribes through `main.events.on` and unsubscribes through
 * `removeListener` risks identity drift across rerenders, leaking listeners
 * on the underlying IpcRenderer (the source of MaxListenersExceeded).
